    I am from the Philippines, however I lived in Singapore ever since I was a year old - so I often confuse whether I consider myself being a real Filipino when I have stayed in Singapore longer than my home country.
    
    Outside school, I play as a keyboardist for a church every 3rd sunday of the month as service. We occasionaly have perfomances throughout the year too.`;
